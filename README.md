# Attentive
The cute smart assistant that lives on your desk (or nightstand). Like a rubber ducky (or teddy bear), but way better.

### At work & ADHD plugin
"I come in to work on Monday, and login to my computer. Presented with my desktop background and a few (okay, a lot of) icons, I hit WINDOWS + L and get a coffee. A coffee will definitely help me decide what to start with today."

### At home & depression plugin:
"I wake up in the morning, but I really don't want to get out of bed. There are too many people I have to talk to. There's no point anyways, what difference will it make if I wake up today."

## Project Pitch (Work/ADHD)

### Problem:
Often during work, people are met with moments of uncertainty during which they distract themselves with something like a coffee or snack. Once back at their desks they're met with the same problem from which they got disctracted.

<!-- Surgeons often have to look away for guidance to a navigation system outside
the sterile area in the operating room. This can be detrimental to the task at hand and lead
to errors or extra time in surgery. -->

### Hypothesis:
<!-- Auditory displays use sound to give users information. We believe that we can
use sound cues to help guide a surgeon to a given target much more accurately and
quickly. -->

### User population: 
<!-- We will focus on neurosurgeons, and work with a few surgeons at the
Montreal Neuro to get feedback. -->

### Prototype:
<!-- As we will build on an existing open-source framework (IBIS), we believe, that
we should have no problem to develop a plug-in that allows for data sonification of distance
information to a target. We will interface the IBIS system with an external audio synthesizer,
and developed an IBIS audio plugin capable of transmitting open sound control (OSC)
messages from IBIS to the pure data audio programming environment. -->
