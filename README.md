# Attentive
The cute smart assistant that lives on your desk. Like a rubber ducky, but way better.

## Project Pitch

N.B. This pitch targets software developers, but the product will be generalized to address the needs of common folk soon.

### Problem:
Software developers tend to overwork themselves and hate planning, estimating, remembering, and making non-code-related choices while they're trying write code.
Current solutions for project management in software development are geared toward team productivity and lack personal management features that devs so dearly need. 
Unfortunately there is a lapse in time management and organization solutions for the individual engineer; and personal tools that do exist, generally, don't integrate nicely with the engineer's work domain.

The workplace can become a stressful environment when you're required to be an expert in your field and be your own secretary too.

### Hypothesis:
The concept of rubber ducky debugging has long been regarded as the golden standard for eliminating undetectable stupidity from code. 



<!-- Secretaries are specialists in managing an individual as part of a larger team and can offload plenty of work, but they're not available 24/7, won't normally tend to your mental health, and they're expensive.


- Rubber duckies are hard to talk to

Everyone has their reasons for diving into a project or codebase and only surfacing for food and coffee.
For me, it's to escape all my other responsibilities that I need to track.
Planning, estimating, remembering, and making choices are all things I'm horrible at. 
Thankfully humans have invented to-do lists and calendars. -->

<!-- Often during work, people are met with moments of uncertainty during which they distract themselves with something like a coffee or snack. Once back at their desks they're met with the same problem from which they originally got disctracted. -->

<!-- Surgeons often have to look away for guidance to a navigation system outside
the sterile area in the operating room. This can be detrimental to the task at hand and lead
to errors or extra time in surgery. -->

### Hypothesis:
<!-- Auditory displays use sound to give users information. We believe that we can
use sound cues to help guide a surgeon to a given target much more accurately and
quickly. -->

### User population: 
<!-- We will focus on neurosurgeons, and work with a few surgeons at the
Montreal Neuro to get feedback. -->

### Prototype:
<!-- As we will build on an existing open-source framework (IBIS), we believe, that
we should have no problem to develop a plug-in that allows for data sonification of distance
information to a target. We will interface the IBIS system with an external audio synthesizer,
and developed an IBIS audio plugin capable of transmitting open sound control (OSC)
messages from IBIS to the pure data audio programming environment. -->

<!-- ## Next Steps

### Rubber Ducky Plugin --- for stupidity in code
"I'm running my code, but it keeps crashing when it tries to instantiate this here object. I'll go find my friend and explain to him every line of code until I realize the stupid mistake I made. I'll then proceed to thank him and tell him to get out of my cubicle so I can get back to work."

### Productivity Plugin --- for ADHD at work 
"I come in to work on Monday, and login to my computer. Presented with my desktop background and a few (okay, a lot of) icons, I hit WINDOWS + L and get a coffee. Maybe a coffee will help me decide what to start with today."

### Motivation Plugin --- for depression at home
"I wake up in the morning, but I really don't want to get out of bed. There are too many people I have to talk to. There's no point anyways, what difference will it make if I wake up today." -->
